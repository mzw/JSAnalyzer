JSAnalyzer
==========

We are developing the JSAnalyzer tool for supporting Ajax applications developments.
JSAnalyzer consists of three main components:

* JSModeler
 - Statically extracting a finite state machine (FSM) from the source code of target Ajax applications
* JSVerifier
 - (Semi-)Automatically verifying whether the extracted FSM satisfies invariants relevant to interactions with Ajax applications
* JSPreventer
 - Supports developers to reveal errors due to potential faults of anti-examples from the verification results
 
We believe that JSAnalyzer helps developers developing and maintaining highly-quality Ajax applications.
Enjoy to run JSAnalyzer!
